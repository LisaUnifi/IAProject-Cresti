# IAProject-Cresti
Project for Artificial Intelligence exam:

- Open the folder named "Code"
- Open "lesson-schedule.mzn" 
- Include one data file between "12-lesson.dzn", "20-lesson.dzn" or "constant-values.dzn"
- Choose the solver between "solve satisfy" or "solve minimize"
- Set the solver configuration to: COIN-BC 2.10/1.17
- Run "lesson-schedule.mzn"

In "Outputs" there are 1 printed output per data file.
